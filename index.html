    <h1>hudson hornet</h1>
    <p class="p1">The Hudson Hornet is a full-size car manufactured by Hudson Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan from 1951 until 1954, when Nash-Kelvinator and Hudson merged to form American Motors Corporation (AMC). Hudson automobiles continued to be marketed
        under the Hudson brand name through the 1957 model year.</p>

    <p class="p2">The first-generation Hudson Hornets featured a functional "step-down" design with dropped floor pan and a chassis with a lower center of gravity than contemporary vehicles that helped the car handle well an advantage for racing. The Hornet's lower
        and sleeker look was accentuated by streamlined styling, sometimes called "ponton" styling. Following the merger forming AMC in 1954, Hudson cars were built on the newer factory assembly line for Nash Statesman/Ambassador unibody chassis; therefore,
        all second-generation Hudson Hornets were restyled Nash automobiles that were badge engineered as a Hudson.</p>
